# How to Convert to PDF

Since this project doesn't have a dedicated PDF generation library configured, here are several ways to convert the documentation to PDF:

## Option 1: Browser Print to PDF (Easiest) ‚≠ê
1. Open: `performance-feature-documentation.html` in your web browser
2. Press: `Ctrl+P` (Windows) or `Cmd+P` (Mac)
3. Click: "Save as PDF"
4. Choose location and click "Save"

This preserves formatting, colors, and styling perfectly!

## Option 2: Command Line Tools

### Using Pandoc (Recommended for Markdown)
```bash
# Install pandoc if needed
# Then run:
pandoc PERFORMANCE_FEATURE_COMPLETE.md -o performance-feature-documentation.pdf
```

### Using wkhtmltopdf
```bash
wkhtmltopdf performance-feature-documentation.html performance-feature-documentation.pdf
```

### Using chromium/puppeteer
```bash
npm install -g puppeteer
npx puppeteer print performance-feature-documentation.html performance-feature-documentation.pdf
```

## Option 3: Online Tools
- **Markdown to PDF**: https://markdowntopdf.com/
- **HTML to PDF**: https://convertio.co/html-pdf/
- **Print Friendly**: https://www.printfriendly.com/

Upload the HTML or Markdown file and download as PDF.

## Option 4: Add PDF Generation to Project

If you want PDF generation built into your app, install jsPDF:

```bash
npm install jspdf html2canvas
```

Then use it in your app to generate PDFs programmatically.
